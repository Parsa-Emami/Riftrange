# RiftRange: forty implementation commits

Updated 2026-10-16. Current implementation is the web foundation; core features are not complete.

Full reference workflow: Validate one fixed template -> start rootless nodes -> prove egress deny -> heartbeat -> kill/restart orchestrator -> reconcile -> run safe scenario -> repeated stop with no resource leaks.

**C30: first locally usable supported product**, after actual verified C01-C30 and clean-host workflow/restart/restore. **C40: complete published OSS v1**, after full source/engine release gates and installation of the published version. No paid account, domain or customer-pilot count is required.

Use `npm run plan -- next` or `npm run plan -- show C07`. These forty work units normally become focused implementation commits; split child IDs only when necessary and keep parent requirement/evidence coverage. Do not create empty quota commits.

C01-C06 establish full engine foundations; C07-C26 implement twenty project-specific capabilities; C27-C30 prove local safety, measured bounds and recovery; C31-C38 finish complete packaging, networking, UX, docs, upgrade, independent onboarding and maintenance; C39-C40 gate and publish real v1 evidence. W01-W08 are a separate historical web track, never proof of C completion.
